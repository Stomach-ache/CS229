## Errors may encounter
1. For people who use Octave 4.0 instead of Matlab, it may occur errors when submit code. [Here](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/community/posts/204693179-linear-regression-submit-error) is the solution to this problem.

## What we can learn from this material
1. How to **plot trainning dataset**. Visualization should be the 1st idea when precessing data. There is a great example of how to code to visualize dataset given by **ex5**.
2. **Gradient check**. It's useful when we need varify if gradient we calculated is correct during gradient decent method. **Ex4** gives us an example of how to implement gradient checker.
